## FAQ

### Is this program a virus?

When you run out of actions, this script blocks your keyboard and mouse. While the script is running, it's watching what mouse and keyboard keys you're pressing while using other programs. Even though this script only counts the key presses, it could technically do a lot more with the information. That's the kind of stuff you want your virus scanner to protect you against, so hopefully it tried to stop you running this program.

If you want to limit your APM, you'll need to reassure your scanner that that's really what you want to do. Make sure you only ever add exceptions for programs you trust. This script is licenced under GPLv3, so you have a right to receive the source code to it, to any modified version of it, and to any other program that uses it. I also suggest verifying the downloaded executable with its provided hash to make sure you received exactly the file you thought you did.

### Does this count as cheating?

AutoHotkey (the tool used to write this script) is most commonly used to write macros, which are usually considered to be cheats. Some games will ban you for running any program written for AutoHotkey while you run their game. Use the tool at your own risk. That said, this particular script will never send any keyboard input on your behalf. Instead, it blocks you from sending input to the game. That's not usually an advantage, in Age of Empires 2 or almost any other game.

If playing with this script improves your decision making in AoE2, then I personally don't think it does so any more than a larger resource UI or turning up your game volume, both of which are allowed by most tournament admins. If showing your actions visually is any kind of advantage, then you can also get an RGB keyboard that lights up when you press keys, so this program's UI probably shouldn't be banned for competitive gameplay either.

Your game's admins have the final authority to declare whether or not using this script counts as cheating in their game though, so be prepared to accept their decision.
